## 7. Design Patterns Applied

| Pattern | Description | Implementation Example |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Observer Pattern** | Automatically triggers notifications and updates when events or tickets change | `TicketObserver`, `SimpleNotificationService` |
| **Service Layer Pattern** | Separates business logic from controllers for modularity | `SimplePaymentService`, `SimpleBookingService` |
| **State Pattern** | Controls allowed transitions for payments and approvals | Payment → Pending → Paid → Refunded |
| **Strategy Pattern** | Dynamically selects logic for user roles or actions | Role-based dashboard behavior |
| **Repository Pattern** | Abstracts query and persistence logic for maintainability | `EventRepository`, `TicketRepository` |
| **Command Pattern** | Encapsulates critical actions like password resets securely | `SimplePasswordResetService` |

These patterns promote **scalability**, **testability**, and **clarity**, while aligning with **SOLID principles**.

## 10. Implementation Overview

This section summarizes how the system was implemented across the backend, frontend, and the development workflow. It reflects the choices made to keep the codebase modular, maintainable, and aligned with Laravel best practices and the SDLC activities carried out during each sprint.

### 10.1 Backend Development

The backend is built on **Laravel 10**, leveraging its expressive syntax, structured project layout, and extensive ecosystem.

- **Framework and Routing**
  - Built on **Laravel 10** to take advantage of modern PHP features and framework stability.
  - Routes organized in `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` with clear naming conventions.
  - Route groups and middleware stacks enforce authentication and role-based access consistently.

- **ORM and Data Layer**
  - **Eloquent ORM** is used for model definitions, relationships, scopes, and query building.
  - Model relationships (e.g., `User` ↔ `Ticket`, `Event` ↔ `Ticket`) reflect the ERD and are optimized with eager loading where appropriate.
  - Repositories (where used) encapsulate query logic to keep controllers and services focused on orchestration.

- **Validation and Requests**
  - **Form Request validation** (classes in `App\Http\Requests`) centralizes input rules and authorization checks.
  - Consistent validation responses improve UX and reduce duplication inside controllers.

- **Middleware and Authorization**
  - **Middleware** enforces authentication, CSRF protection, and role-based access control (e.g., `admin`, `organizer`, `user`).
  - Policies and gates (where applicable) provide fine-grained authorization, complementing middleware.

- **Business Logic and Services**
  - Services encapsulate domain logic (e.g., approval, booking, payments, notifications) to keep controllers thin and testable.
  - Observers listen to model lifecycle events to update availability and dispatch notifications automatically.

- **Error Handling and Logging**
  - Centralized exception handling in `App\Exceptions\Handler`.
  - Application logs tagged by request ID and user context simplify incident review.

### 10.2 Frontend Development

The frontend is composed using **Blade templates** and **Tailwind CSS**, balancing productivity with performance and maintainability.

- **Templating**
  - **Blade** templates and partials (`resources/views`) for layout reuse and componentization.
  - View composers or dedicated controllers pass only necessary data to views to avoid over-fetching.

- **Styling and Responsiveness**
  - **Tailwind CSS** ensures a consistent, responsive design system and utility-first development.
  - Shared components (headers, footers, cards, tables, modals) standardize the UI.

- **Interaction and Feedback**
  - Progressive enhancement patterns for forms, pagination, and filters.
  - Optional animation libraries (such as AOS) used sparingly to maintain performance and focus.

### 10.3 GitHub Integration

Development followed a branch-based workflow tightly integrated with Jira.

- **Branching and Traceability**
  - Each Jira task mapped to a corresponding **Git branch** (for example, `EMTS-105-Add-eye-icon-in-register-page`, `EMTS-47-Improve-approval-form`).
  - Commit messages include Jira keys for end-to-end traceability.

- **Pull Requests and Reviews**
  - **Pull Requests** are the integration gateway, enabling peer review, CI checks, and discussion.
  - Enforced branch protection rules (where enabled) prevent direct pushes to `main`.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
  - CI runs migrations and seeders on a test database before merges where configured.
  - Static analysis and test suites help maintain quality standards.

## 14. Security Features


Security is enforced across multiple layers to protect **users**, **events**, and **transactions**.  
The system leverages Laravel’s robust security framework, combined with additional safeguards and best practices, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and operations.

---


### Authentication and Authorization
- Built upon **Laravel’s authentication scaffolding**, integrating **role-based permissions** for fine-grained access control.  
- Guarded routes require valid authentication and appropriate roles (`admin`, `organizer`, `user`).  
- Session and token management handled by Laravel’s secure authentication guards.  
- Unauthorized access attempts are logged for audit and review.

---

### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Middleware** enforces access based on user roles and ownership of resources.  
- **Administrative operations** such as event approval and payment management are restricted to verified admin users.  
- Each operation is **scoped, logged, and auditable** to maintain transparency.  
- Controllers remain lightweight, delegating security enforcement to middleware and policies.

---


### CSRF and XSS Protection
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** protection automatically applied to all POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests using Laravel’s token mechanism.  
- All Blade templates escape output by default, preventing **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.  
- User input is validated and sanitized before being persisted to the database.  
- Strict validation rules prevent injection of HTML or malicious scripts in form fields.

---


### Validation Rules
- **Form Request classes** validate incoming payloads and perform authorization before controller logic executes.  
- Consistent error messages and structured JSON responses maintain UX and debugging consistency.  
- Validation includes field type checking, input length restrictions, format patterns, and custom rule enforcement for sensitive fields.  
- Business-critical validations (e.g., payment amount, event status) implemented at both controller and model level.

---


### Error Handling
- Centralized **exception handling** in `App\Exceptions\Handler` ensures all errors are captured and logged appropriately.  
- Custom renderers for sensitive errors prevent exposure of system internals in production.  
- Errors are classified by severity and context to streamline incident analysis.  
- Logging includes timestamp, user ID, request path, and stack trace, enabling precise debugging and audit capabilities.

---


### Additional Hardening (Recommended)
- **Rate limiting** applied to authentication, registration, and payment routes to prevent brute-force attacks.  
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers configured to control script and resource origins, reducing injection risks.  
- **Secure cookie flags** (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) enabled for all authentication and session cookies.  
- **Session configuration** uses encrypted, database-backed or Redis-based sessions for enhanced reliability.  
- Regular dependency audits performed via Composer to identify and patch known vulnerabilities.  

---

These combined measures ensure that EMTS remains resilient against common web threats such as injection, forgery, cross-site attacks, and unauthorized access — maintaining trust, compliance, and system stability.

## 15. Performance and Optimization

Performance optimization was implemented across the **database**, **application**, and **frontend** layers to ensure scalability, fast response times, and resource efficiency.  
This section outlines the strategies used to enhance system performance throughout development and deployment.

---

### Database Optimization
- **Query Optimization:**  
  Indexes were created on foreign keys and frequently queried columns to reduce lookup times.  
  Complex queries were refactored into optimized Eloquent relationships or query builder syntax.  

- **Avoiding N+1 Problems:**  
  Implemented **eager loading** (`with`) and **query scopes** to prevent excessive database calls, particularly in ticket and event listing pages.  
  Lazy loading was only used when necessary to minimize memory consumption.

- **Pagination:**  
  Pagination was applied on all major listing endpoints (e.g., events, tickets, bookings) to reduce data payload size and improve response performance.  
  This ensures smooth user experience even when handling large datasets.

- **Connection Pooling and Transactions:**  
  Database transactions were applied in payment and booking operations to ensure atomicity and rollback safety.  
  Persistent connections reduced connection overhead under high load conditions.

---

### Application Layer Optimization
- **Response Caching:**  
  Implemented caching for frequently accessed public content such as published events and reports using Laravel’s built-in cache mechanisms.  
  This reduced repetitive database queries and improved page load times.

- **Configuration and Route Caching:**  
  During production deployment, configuration, route, and view caches were generated using the following commands:
  ```bash
  php artisan config:cache
  php artisan route:cache
  php artisan view:cache
  php artisan event:cache

## 15. Performance and Optimization

Performance improvements were strategically implemented at the **database**, **application**, and **frontend** layers to ensure that the Event Management & Ticketing System (EMTS) performs efficiently under real-world conditions.

---

### Database
- **Query Optimization:**  
  Optimized queries by adding indexes on foreign keys and frequently filtered columns to improve lookup speed and reduce execution time.  
  Regular query analysis ensured consistent performance across large datasets.

- **Avoiding N+1 Issues:**  
  Implemented **eager loading** (`with`) and **query scopes** to eliminate redundant database calls.  
  This ensures that related data (like event tickets or user profiles) is fetched efficiently in a single query.

- **Pagination:**  
  Applied pagination to listing endpoints such as events, users, and bookings to reduce payload size and improve page rendering time.  
  This ensures scalable performance even with large datasets.

---

### Application
- **Response Caching:**  
  Cached responses for frequently accessed public pages such as event listings, dashboards, and reports.  
  This reduces redundant queries and speeds up page loading.

- **Configuration and Route Caching:**  
  Used Laravel’s built-in caching mechanisms (`config:cache`, `route:cache`, `view:cache`) in production for faster response times.  
  These optimizations minimize bootstrapping time and improve performance during heavy traffic.

- **Efficient Serialization:**  
  For API endpoints and internal data exchange, utilized resource transformers and optimized serializers to remove unnecessary data.  
  This ensures faster API responses and reduced bandwidth consumption.

---

### Assets and Frontend
- **Asset Optimization:**  
  All assets were processed and versioned using **Vite** (or Laravel Mix) for minification and cache-busting.  
  This ensures clients always receive the latest assets without manual cache clearing.

- **Deferred Loading:**  
  Non-critical scripts were deferred to load after the main page content, improving initial render speed and Time to Interactive (TTI).  

- **Optimized Images and SVGs:**  
  Image assets were compressed and SVGs were used for icons and vector graphics to maintain sharp visuals with minimal load.  
  Combined with lazy loading, this significantly enhanced perceived performance on the frontend.

---

### Observability
- **Query Logs and Profiling:**  
  Enabled query logs and profiling in local and staging environments to identify bottlenecks and optimize slow queries.  
  Tools like Laravel Telescope were used for in-depth analysis.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Monitored cache hit ratios, queue latency, and background job performance.  
  This allowed early detection of inefficiencies and helped in fine-tuning caching strategies.

---
